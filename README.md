# Connection-btw-2-RaspberryPis

# What the project does?

The repository contain two python files:-

1)client.py

2)server.py

Raspberry Pi containing client.py will send the data using LAN in string format and the raspberry pi containing server.py will receive the string(data).


# Why the project is useful?

The project is useful in making a serial communication between two raspberry pi's. It helps in collecting information from one raspberry pi to another.

# How users can get started with the project?

Download client.py in that raspberry pi from which you want to send data and download server.py in that raspberry pi in which you want to receive the data.

Assign the IP address to 'host' variable in both server.py and client.py. IP address of raspberry pi which has client.py file will be assigned.
Assign the port number in both file sever.py and client.py. It will be same for both.
